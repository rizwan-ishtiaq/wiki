# Linux
Initially, you will need a screen recording app. https://itsfoss.com/best-linux-screen-recorders/ 

Most of these will allow you to record your screen and voice simultaneously. For your voice, I would use a headset microphone as it will be of higher quality than the one built into your laptop. I would prepare a script of what you’d like to say and then run through the process while speaking a couple of times to make sure it’s making sense visually before recording. A well-rehearsed presentation will both appear more professional and help reduce the amount of edit work you will need to do. Once you’ve recorded your video most screen recorders will let you perform a simple top and tail edit to tidy up the file. Export the file in your preferred codec, YouTube accepts many but a .mp4 is the most popular. 

This may be sufficient for you. However, if you wanted to have more control once you’ve recorded the video you could then bring that exported .mp4 file into a video editor. https://itsfoss.com/best-video-editing-software-linux/#kdenlive 

Here you could do some additional work such as delete dead spaces, speed up certain steps or processes, add text overlays etc. You could even add a new voice-over separately. I think your best course of action would be to download a couple of the free tools available and play around with them to see if they will suit your needs.

I’m a big fan of Sennheiser. This one, the Sennheiser PC 8, is really good and not too expensive. https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sennheiser-PC-USB-Internet-Telephony/dp/B005HWEZGG?tag=greshomal-21 If you are looking for something cheaper, then an older version of this one would might do, the PC 6 or PC 7 etc. There’s lots of other options out there too but generally you can’t go wrong with Sennheiser. 

# Mac
Most Macs will have iMovie preinstalled on them, if not it’s a free download from the Apple App Store: https://itunes.apple.com/gb/app/imovie/id377298193?mt=8&v0=www-us-ios-imovie-app-imovie 
This is a very user friendly basic video editing platform. 

If you are hoping to record your screen, Quicktime on Mac has this feature already built in. On a PC there are 100’s of screen recording apps available so it just a matter of searching for one that fits your needs. Some are free many are not. 

If you’re looking for a more advanced video editing software package, Avid Media Composer offers a completely free version of their editing software. It will have a steeper learning curve than something like iMovie but is available on both Mac and PC.

# Voice
Sounds like electrical hum, can sometimes be an issue. Try the headphones on any other machines first? Some people recommend disabling the headphone and microphone jacks while using a USB mic as this might get rid of it.
