# Starting/registering service worker
* npm build then serve -s build
* (by default) you will not able to register servicework with npm start
* in case you try to hack env===production logic, with default logic inplace it will not be able to find service worker file (will be created on prebuild phase workbox-webpack-plugin) and you will get "text/html not valid type" error while registering
* use intango mode or create new browser user to avoid cache problems

# service worker
* workbox-webpack-plugin automatic create service-worker.js for us
* precache every thing in src directory
* add fetch listerner for us- uses cache first strategy
* caches and responds to requests for URLs in the manifest
* create react app's registration method will not provide much control by default
  * tweek it to let you know when new updates came
  * when waiting service worker is successfully install

# Communication
* when your app want to communicate/control SW it can pass config to the serviceWorker.register() method
* config will have two methods onUpdate, onSuccess
  * onUpdate will be called whenever there will be any change in SW
  * both methods will have ServiceWorkerRegistration as argument
* wrokbox plugin will create code on service worker to listen for skip message

# API request caching
* if you don't want to change/append code to service work generated by workbox, use indexdb to store results and serve from there
